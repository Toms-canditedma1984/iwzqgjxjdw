Wow, okay. Just walked out of seeing Until Dawn and my brain’s still spinning, like I swear, that hour-and-a-half felt like one of those nights that hopelessly stretch on right before a cake delivery deadline. You know when you’re up to your elbows in flour and time makes no sense — kinda like that. But bloodier. God, what was even happening half the time? 

The theater was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing, sort of like stepping into a walk-in 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zer, waiting for the suspense to bake into something or no, like a souffle, almost. Anyway, there were these wild twisty turns, like my panic scrambling for vanilla extract mid-cake. The jump scares were popcorn-jolting, swear I've got popcorn embedded in my spine.. it was hardly cinematic sugarcoating! And the times those jump scares got me—jeez! Phew, skull pastry anyone? My thoughts are the crumbs, the plot’s the rolling pin I can’t find.

> Man those scenes with the storm, wild — gave me whiplash right there in the seat. Like when I forgot to add sugar in the meringue that one time. And the sound, the sound! It was a lot of noise, mostly trying to keep up with all the dialogues and the crunchy popcorn soundtrack of the room. My brain was saying '𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ,' my heart screaming 'run!'

By the way, don't forget cuz someone asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Totally worth it, but could get distracting when a character yells something unintelligible, leaving you staring ahead, half expecting ganache icing to drip silently down those ominous hallways. The plot holes, like unexpected deflating pies, just when you think they’ve settled... never safe tho, not even when things seem less mad.

The way the actors moved through the scenes was like desperately frosting cake layers on a wobbly stand. There was chaos, panic - complete with that one eerie, slow scene that felt almost tranquil—kinda like when I'm just sifting powdered sugar peacefully between rushes. Until all hell breaks loose again, and I’m back to furiously piping decorations on a near-collapsing soufflé of tension and red herrings.

Feel like I went through a mixer’s spin cycle — if you ever wonder why?, think frantic whisking of emotional damage & stress-induced wrinkles. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it, or don’t, if headaches and horror aren’t your go-to recipes. But then, I reckon anyone should experience it, like trying a deceptively pretty macaron with a surprise punch.

int main() {
   int cake = 0;
   double frosting[3.14];
   cake.bake();
   return muffins;
}
